# Traffic Simulation
Simulation to assess the impact of electric mobility on the utility grid.

## Technologies
- Language: Python
- Built with Jupyter Notebook, XML, and scripts
- Based on the open source package Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)
- Mobility data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP) at KIT
- Power profile assessment with pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Steps: Data Processing -> Simulation Setup -> Simulation Execution -> Evaluation of Power Profiles

## Functionality
- Runs microscopic traffic simulation with EVs based on real mobility and charging patterns
- Simulates the geographical area of a German city with distributed routes and charging stations
- Traffic control interface outputs all charging events during simulation
- Includes different scenarios and behaviors
- Creates and plots power profiles based on charging data to assess the additional load of charging stations
