# EV Traffic/Charging Simulation
EV traffic/charging simulation to assess the impact of electric mobility on the power grid with real mobility patterns and power profiles.

## Technologies
- Language: Python
- Built with Python Libraries (pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) and Scripts
- Based on the Open Source Package: Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)
- Data from the German Mobility Panel (MOP) at KIT
- Steps: Data Processing -> Simulation Setup -> Simulation Execution -> Evaluation of Power Profiles

## Functionality
- Runs microscopic traffic simulation with EVs based on real mobility and charging patterns of a German city
- Simulates the geographical area of a German city with distributed routes and charging stations
- Traffic control interface outputs all charging events during the simulation
- Includes different scenarios and behaviors
- Creates and plots power profiles based on charging data to assess the additional load of charging stations
